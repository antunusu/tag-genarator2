## Project Structure

```
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── styles.css          # CSS styles

## How It Works

The current implementation uses a client-side approach with predefined tag categories. In a production environment, this would be replaced with:

1. A backend API that analyzes video titles and descriptions
2. Machine learning algorithms to identify relevant tags
3. Data from trending videos to suggest popular tags
4. User authentication for saving favorite tags
